      <description>The Chaos Game In this excellent Numberphile video Ben Sparks demonstrates how to generate a fractal structure (the Sierpinsky Triangle) by putting constraints (or rules) on a random process. The random process in this case is rolling a die, or, equivalently, drawing a random number from \(\mathcal{U}(1,6)\).
HUGOMORE42    Generating Order by Constraining Randomness This result may seem like a nice mathematical/statistical oddity, but there is some potentially deep knowledge about structure of reality to be uncovered here.</description>

      <description>Why?
No reason, this is the accidental mathematician category.
Pandigital numbers Pandigital numbers aren’t that special, it’s a number that has all digits from 1-9, or, 0-9 in it.
For example: 381654729 is a pandigital number (with some extra properties)
  Pandigital functions As Complexity Scientists (and musicians and artists in general) know:
 Interesting things will happen when the degrees of freedom available to a system to generate its behaviour, are reduced.</description>
