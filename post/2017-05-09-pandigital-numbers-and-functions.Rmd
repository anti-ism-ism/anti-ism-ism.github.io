Why?

No reason, this is the `accidental mathematician` category.

## Pandigital numbers

Pandigital numbers aren't that special, it's a number that has all digits from 1-9, or, 0-9 in it.

`r htmltools::HTML("{{% alert note %}}")`
For example: 381654729 is a pandigital number (with some [extra properties](https://youtu.be/gaVMrqzb91w?t=46s))
`r htmltools::HTML("{{% /alert %}}")`

## Pandigital functions

As Complexity Scientists (and musicians and artists in general) know: 

> Interesting things will happen when the degrees of freedom available to a system to generate its behaviour, are reduced.

Now, the pandigital constraint can become very interesting when applied to functions, or rather, mathematical operators.
The rules are:

* Take a *pandigital* number
* Stick any mathematical operator between any cluster of digits
* Attempt to get an interesting outcome

Turns out such a pandigital formula is able to approximate the trancendental number $e$ with uncanny precision!

$$e\approx\left (1 + 9^{-4^{6*7}} \right)^{3^{2^{85}}}$$

It was discovered by [Richard Sabey in 2004](http://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/mathmagic/0804.html).

The **Numberphile** channel has a great video on it:
