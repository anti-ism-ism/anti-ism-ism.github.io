      <description>Using R to Compute Effect Size Confidence Intervals This is a demonstration of using R in the context of hypothesis testing by means of Effect Size Confidence Intervals. In other words, we’ll calculate confidence intervals based on the distribution of a test statistic under the assumption that \(H_0\) is false, the noncentral distribution of a test statistic.
Discrete distributions: Count data and proportions  Discrete CI ≠ Approximately Continuous CI Noncentral CIs around the Odds Ratio of Fisher’s Exact Test Example: Time, Money, and Morality  Continuous distributions: Standardised sample means  Standardised, but on which measure of dispersion?</description>

 Introduction The Time, Money, and Morality article has been HIBAR-ed on Twitter and the Blogosphere (e.g., by Rolf Zwaan and Greg Francis ) and the discussion seems to revolve around the validity of the inferences based p-values close to 0.05 (e.g., they raise suspicions of p-hacking).</description>
