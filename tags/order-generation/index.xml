      <description>The Chaos Game In this excellent Numberphile video Ben Sparks demonstrates how to generate a fractal structure (the Sierpinsky Triangle) by putting constraints (or rules) on a random process. The random process in this case is rolling a die, or, equivalently, drawing a random number from \(\mathcal{U}(1,6)\).
